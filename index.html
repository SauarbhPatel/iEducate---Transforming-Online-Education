            <p class="sectionTag test-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. <br><br> From this point on the central and state governments shared
                formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now
                with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states
                in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. schools and the
                number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag test-big">Transforming Education In India</p>
            <p class="sectionTag test-small">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the central
                government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved by the Union
                Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system. The new policy
                replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary
                education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy
                aims to transform India's education system by 2021. <br> <br>

                The National Education Policy 2020 has ‘emphasised’ on the use of mother tongue or local language as the
                medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond.It also
                states that no language will be imposed on the students.The language policy in NEP is a broad guideline
                and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the
                implementation.Education in India is a Concurrent List subject. </p>

            <p class="sectionTag test-small">Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share
                internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European
                Socrates-Erasmus Programme facilitates exchanges across European universities. The Soros Foundation
                provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the
                International Baccalaureate have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus
                online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded
                during the actual classes. <br> <br>

                The Programme for International Student Assessment and the International Association for the Evaluation
                of Educational Achievement objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range
                of different nations. <br> <br>

                The internationalization of education is sometimes equated by critics with the westernization of
                education. These critics say that the internationalization of education leads to the erosion of local
                education systems and indigenous values and norms, which are replaced with Western systems and cultural
                and ideological values and orientation.</p>
